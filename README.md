## Contribution
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

The code logic is very simple:
```ruby
if File.exist?(filepath)
  if File.image?(filepath)
    push_notification('Uploading... Please wait for seconds', filepath)
    search_image(filepath.shellescape)
  else
    push_notification('Please upload an image', filepath)
  end
elsif extract_urls(query).any?
  open_urls(query)
else
  search_text(query)
end
```
