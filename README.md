## Contribution
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

The code logic is very simple:
```ruby
if File.exist?(filepath)
  if File.image?(filepath)
    search_image(filepath)
  else
    push_notification('Please select an image', 'Supports jpg, gif, png, bmp, tif, or webp')
  end
elsif extract_urls(query).any?
  open_urls(query)
else
  search_text(query)
end
```

- Image search was inspired by https://github.com/BlackwinMin/alfred-gallery/tree/master/img%20Search
- It was built with [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) which helped me improve the code quality a lot.

I tried write it with Python, it was not simple at all, I had to deal with some package/language issues. Pain!<br> 
I tried write it with Shell, all I did was trying to figure out the syntax. Deep Pain!<br>
I tried write it with Go, well I never get started. Lost...<br>
I tried Ruby(with little Shell code inside), it just worked without much pain! ðŸ’– I really enjoyed it!<br>
